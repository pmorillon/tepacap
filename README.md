## Tepacap

Tepacap is an overload of the capistrano's _run_ parallel command.

Add following features :

* Continue if one of the server is not reachable.
* Sort the output by server at the end of execution.

## Usage

Add this into your Capfile :

    require "tepacap"

You can have a different user for gateway and servers :

    set :user, "user_for_servers" # default user for servers and gateway

    set :gateway, "your_gateway_server"
    set :gateway_user, "user_for_gateway"

## Result

Here the server _parapluie-27.rennes.grid5000.fr_ is not reachable.
